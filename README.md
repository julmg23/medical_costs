# Medical Cost Interactive Dashbboard 
In this project, I used SQL, MYSQL, and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard about medical costs in the US. The original dataset I used is from kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). I imported the data to MYSQL, claned and validated the data, exported it as a csv file and then made the final dashboard in Power BI.

Unfortunately, Power BI dashboard cannot be viewed by non users so I have included the original Power BI file in this repository. I also converted the dashboard to a PDF and an image, both are viewable in the repository and I included the image below!
