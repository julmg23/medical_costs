# Medical Cost Interactive Dashbboard 
In this project, I used SQL, MYSQL, and Power BI to create an interactive dashboard about medical costs in the US.

Unfortunately, Power BI dashboard cannot be viewed by non users so I have included the original Power BI file in this repository. I also converted the dashboard to a PDF and an image, both are viewable in the repository and I included the image below!
